Your roommates are noisy, and the library's quiet study rooms are hopelessly booked up, where oh where will you do your interviews? Aha, you say to yourself, the University of Waterloo's renowned CEEHub™ has quiet rooms!

You quickly go to WaterlooWorks and submit a form requesting a room to do your interview. Your interview is in 3 days, surely you'll hear back before then. You check your email every day, but nothing from CEEHub™. The days slip away. Today's your interview. You open up WaterlooWorks to double-check that you did indeed submit a form, only to discover that quietly the hard workers at CEEHub™ have approved your request and you have a room!

You rejoice, this journey has come to an end, and you have a quiet peaceful room to do your interview in. You waltz along the cobbled streets of campus as you approach the handsome, modern-looking headquarters of CEEHub™ - the Tatham Centre. The interiors are luxurious, you can't help but get your hopes up about the interview room. You salivate as you imagine a nice room with a big window and a big white table. You wander up the stairs to the "Call Centres" on the second floor, enjoying the daydream. You find your way to 2212 where you'll be having your interview....

The rooms are awfully close together, tiny booths, but that's fine, you tell yourself. As long as it's well lit, has a table, and is quiet, it's all good. Considering that the University of Waterloo touts its co-op program surely, this is the bare minimum?

But as you gaze into the window of an empty booth you see... a tiny dimly lit room with LIME GREEN WALLS and a LEDGE instead of a table! You're shocked. "I pay so much tu-tu-tu-tuition and this is what they do," you stammer as you grab the wall to steady yourself.

It's 1:20pm, your interview is at 1:30pm, you sit in a chair and contemplate the unfortunate series of turns your life took. The minutes pass, it's now 1:25pm but the person sitting in the booth hasn't left. You run down the stairs to the ground floor where the hard workers at CEEHub™ sit. You stammer out, "The person, the person in my booth, they haven't left," but you are met with a cold stare. "We keep a buffer of 20 minutes," they say. Come back if the person still hasn't left when its actually time for your interview, they say. Their indifference leaves you shocked.

It's 1:28pm as you rush back upstairs. You walk close to the booth in question and peer in. The person in your booth is talking to a friend - their interview is over! You knock, they look at you confused, "I booked this room for 1pm," you say, attempting to hide your unhappiness. They stammer out a quick apology and start packing up.

At exactly 1:30 pm, they come out and you prepare to rush in with your laptop open and Google Meet loaded... only to be hit by a wall of stale air. That's right, the great rooms of Tatham Centre even lack ventilation! You are unfazed, you have an interview to do, even if it means you catch the respiratory diseases of every prior inhabitant of the room. You set your laptop down on the LEDGE, only half your laptop fits, and the stupidly placed old Dell Monitor that hands above the ledge for no apparent reason casts a shadow over the webcam. The awkwardly placed light is weak and the overall room lighting is not helped by the LIME GREEN WALL and makes your face seem like a dark blur. You curse your dark complexion and quickly join the meeting.

The interviewer goes about some questions from your resume, the poor lighting conceals the lines on your face. You used to be young but the wonders of CEEHub™ have aged you considerably.

"Let's move on to the coding questions," the interviewer says, and you feel dead inside. Given that only half your laptop fits on the ledge, typing is a bit tricky, to say the least. You type your for loops and while loops at a furious pace, keen to show the world that no matter the horrors it throws at you, you will not give up. Unfortunately, you press the backspace a little too hard - perhaps it's all the aggression you feel towards CEEHub™ - and the entire laptop flips off the ledge and hits you in the chest.

But after the trauma of the last few hours nothing can faze you - you are dead inside. You laugh mirthlessly and set the laptop back on the ledge.

The interviewer looks confused, but you apologize and the interview continues. Several minutes later you awkwardly thank the interviewer multiple times not knowing whether to leave the meeting first or not. Eventually, the interviewer ends the call and you pick up your things.

You walk slowly back down the stairs, a shell of the man you were when you walked in. You stop at the reception and look at the CEEHub™ individual. 
"The rooms are poorly lit and there isn't even a desk to put my laptop," you say. 
"This is the way things have always been done... even before COVID," you are told by the CEEHub™ individual. 
You cannot fathom the ridiculousness of this statement. Before COVID, interviews were not remote so it makes sense that the infrastructure to deal with remote interviews was poor - these rooms were probably used for phone screens. But after COVID, 99% of interviews have been remote so why on earth would you use the before COVID standard for after COVID and then say "even before COVID" as if that makes even an iota of sense?

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

You cannot take it anymore. You rip your shirt off to reveal the deep aquamarine of your Superman suit. Your eyes turn a deep red, your chest expands and from deep inside you the rage bubbles up. A guttural scream emanates from your lungs as you incinerate CEEHub™ to the ground with your laser eyes.

Justice has been served.
